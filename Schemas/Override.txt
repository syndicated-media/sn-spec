Introduction

The Overrides namespaace is an extension to RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 feeds 
that allows a a newer item/entry to replace or override an older one.

Replacing an item can be useful in a couple of situations, you could 
release a corrupt enclosure and want to force clients to re download the 
file. Or you could also want to rerun a previous episode.

overrides:replaces

The replaces element is a optional child of item or entry. It's value is 
either a previous guid (in RSS) or id (in Atom), the item referenced has 
likely been removed from the feed but may be cached by the client.

The client should then purge the old item in favour of this one.

An item or entry must not contain more than one replaces element.

overrides:rerun

The rerun element is a optional child of item or entry. It value is 
either a previous guid (in RSS) or id (in Atom), the item referenced may 
or may not still be in the feed and may or may not be cached by the 
client.

This allows the client to treat reruns differently to ordinary items, and 
also link any status information between the two items. 

An item or entry must not contain more than one rerun element. In the 
case of a item being rerun multiple times the value should be the guid 
of the oldest occurrence.

The RSS or Atom source element should also be used in reruns.

Example

In this example there was in issue with Episode 3 release, the original 
item has been removed and the new one replaces it. Episode 1 also gets 
rerun twice.
